# Student Attendance Management
This project is to computerize the traditional way of marking attendance on a daily basis.
The main entities are admin,faculty and student.
Main functionalities of admin include adding a course,faculty,department and student.
Main functionalities of faculty include checking his/her courses,enrolling a student and marking attendance.
Main functionalities of student include checking his/her courses,attendance percentage of each course and notifications.
I'm attaching a database file(dbms.sql) along with the program files so that you can directly create the database.
